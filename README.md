As it is clear by name, Recommender System is a piece of software that recommends us the relevant products or services
# Content-Based-Recommendation-System
Content Based Recommender System recommends items similar to the items user likes. We are going to make a Hollywood movie recommended system in Python.
For example, Netflix recommends us the similar movies to the movie we recently watched
How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here we use the similarity scores.
Similarity score is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a
scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. 
So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items.
